# Self-Driving-Car-using-OpenCV
The repository will contain multiple scripts that I learned and executed in order to understand the following concepts:
* NumPy
* OpenCV - to find and identify lane lines
* Using the concept of a Perceptron with Keras for Binary Classification
* Deep Neural Networks
* Self Driving Car Simulator using Behavioral Cloning, OpenCV and TensorFlow
