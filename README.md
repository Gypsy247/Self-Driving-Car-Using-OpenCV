# Self-Driving-Car-using-OpenCV
The repository will contain multiple scripts that I learned and executed in order to understand the following concepts:
* NumPy
* OpenCV - to find and identify lane lines
* The Perceptron
* Keras for Binary Classification
* Deep Neural Networks
* Multiclass Classifications of Handwritten Digits (MNIST Dataset)
* Multiclass Classification of Road Symbols/Traffic Signs
